# MathMentor: Custom LMS for Mathematics Tuition Classes (Grades 6â€“11)

---

## Project Overview

MathMentor is a full-stack Learning Management System (LMS) tailored specifically for managing private mathematics tuition classes for grades 6 to 11. This platform empowers a single admin (the tutor) to manage students, track attendance via QR codes, handle fee payments, record academic progress, and visualize performance data â€” all in one intuitive dashboard.

This project demonstrates my skills in modern web development, authentication flows, real-time attendance systems, data visualization, and deployment using industry-standard tools and best practices.
